# deep-learning-addition
A LSTM model that learns to perform arithmetic addition on integers. It's a simple Deep Learning calculator.

Example: 12 + 134 = 146

## Development

- Python 3.6 and 2.7
- For Python 2.7 replace the value of `REQUIRED_PYTHON` and `PYTHON_INTERPRETER` in `test_environment.py` and `Makefile`, respectively, to `python2`
- [awscli](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/awscli) installed and configured

## Commands
```
clean               Delete all compiled Python files 
create_environment  Set up python interpreter environment 
data                Make Dataset 
lint                Lint using flake8 
requirements        Install Python Dependencies 
test_environment    Test python environment is setup correctly 
train               Train Deep Learning Model 
```
